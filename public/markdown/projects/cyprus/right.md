# Cyprus Project

**Cyprus** â€“ a project for a Cypriot real estate developer, aimed at consolidating all property and client data in one place.  

The goal of the project was to provide agents with easy access to up-to-date information and deliver the best service for managing properties and clients.  

The implementation was done using **WolverineFX**, ensuring reliable communication between services and modules.  
The architecture is based on **Vertical Slices**, providing modularity and simplifying maintenance.
